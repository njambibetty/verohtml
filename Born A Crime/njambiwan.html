	<h1>Born A Crime: Apartheid Regime and Bravery.</h1>
    <h2>Division</h2>
    <p>Trevor starts by showing us the sense of being relieved as Mandela is released from prison and everyone was so happy. Even though there was a Bloodless Revolution, the citizens were still torn between which Black man to rule. “The genius of apartheid was convincing people who were overwhelming majority to turn on each other.” Spates of violence broke between different political parties as they jockeyed for power especially the ones led by Xhosa and Zulu people. Instead of uniting the disunited nation for peace they turned on one another, committed all sorts of atrocities against each other and all hell broke loose. If one was not your fellow tribesman he or she was your enemy. This reminds me of the incident of Trevor, Baby Andrew and Patricia jumping out of a moving car due to the hostility of the Zulu driver.</p>

   <h3><b><em>Racial Segregation</em></b></h3>
    <p>"In any society built of institutionalized race-mixing does not merely challenge the system as unjust, it reveals the system as unsustainable and incoherent. “People were separated from one another according to their races. Whites dealt with the Whites, Indians with Indians, Coloureds with Coloureds and Blacks with Blacks. There was no intermingling. If anyone was caught for instance a Black and a White that was punishable by law and the penalty was five years. There were the “finest law enforcement officers”, who were peeking through people's windows to see whether they will sight an interracial couple. Trevor was born a crime his mother had to lie that his father is from Swaziland, because the apartheid government had to categorize everything, and since he was biracial he was a proof of his parent's criminality. When Trevor was a toddler, going to the park with his parents would draw a lot of attention since it was illegal to be mixed and legal to be colored, Patricia schemed a plan of using Queen, her friend to act as Trevor’s mum since she was colored while Patricia walked behind them and posed as a maid. Trevor grew up as a lone wolf in his childhood days since he was not allowed to go outside and play with the other children due to his color. If the police saw him they would haul him to an orphanage and strip off his custody from Patricia. When kids in Soweto saw Trevor they used to be astonished  and others would run while the other people would use him as a landmark around the block. Racism had crippled Blacks mind making them think they are the most stupid people. For instance Trevor’s grandfather used to call him “Mastah.” While driving, he would insist to Trevor to sit at the back left and drive him like his chauffer. Prayers prayed by Trevor were answered first simply because he was White and spoke good English ,simply that was what his granndmother and the other fellowship women used to think. Mode of disciplining a Black child was more severe and harsh unlike that of a White or a Colored child. For instance Trevor’s grandmother never punished him but used to punish his cousins. Education system in the government schools was crippled too. Classes were classified into two. The “A” classes for the Whites and Coloreds and the “B” classes for the Blacks. Also the Afrikaner government found a way to cripple the black minds and came up with the idea of Bantu schools. “Why give a book to a monkey?” Bantu schools only taught metrics and agriculture. There was no science, civics or history while the mission schools majorly dominated by the Whites taught English, Law, Medicine and European Literature. Their mission was to Christianize and westernize natives. “If a monkey can walk like a man then perhaps his a man.” The Whites lived in the White estates only, Coloureds in Eden Park and Blacks in Soweto. Races could not use distinctive facilities like hospitals and roads.</p>

    <h4><b><em>Slavery</em></b></h4>
    <p>Black men were forced either to work on the farms, factory or a mine. Black women either worked in a factory or as a maid. Blacks were forced to carry their ID cards and stay within curfew hours or risk arrest especially for the ones living in Soweto. In Soweto there were no basic human entitlements like stores, bars paved roads but minimum electricity inadequate sewerage and poor sanitation like toilets full of flies were in plenty. Your status as a labourer were the only thing that permitted you to stay in Soweto. If your parent's papers were revoked you would be displaced back to the homelands.</p>

    <h5><b><em>Displacement</em></b></h5>
    <p>Government seized people’s homes and the Blacks were settled in Soweto. The ultimate goal of apartheid was to make South Africa a Whiteman’s country and Blacks to be relocated to live in the Bantustans and homelands. The place was designed poorly yet it hosted millions who lived in shanties and survived through the black market economy of operating Spazas and Shebeens.</p>

    <h6><b><em>Bravery</em></b></h6>
    <p>Patricia lived in Hillbrow a place full of Germans and Portuguese and she was never afraid to get arrested. Not only was Trevor’s family dominated by women but also for the kids around the block since their fathers were exiled as they were fighting for the cause. Women held the community together.Patricia refused to be part of <em> the black tax</em>
    that is the curse of being black and poor from generation to generation.She also took a huge step as she undertook course about secetarial yet Black women had only two options to choose from.When she was young she also ran into the city which was unknown to her was determined to sleep in public restrooms,rely on prostitues help for her not to suffer the same fate like the rest of her people.She refused to give trevor an African name because she did not want it to bear any resemblance on him. She also taught him English as his first language, bought him books and encyclopedias fot him to read and gain the skills unlike other African mothers.</p>
